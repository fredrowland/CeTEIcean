                    <p>The copy-text for the body of the play in this edition is based on the first
                        edition, first issue, provided courtesy of the University of Washington
                        Libraries, which Peter Lewis and others have established is the most
                        authoritative. The copy-text for the scored music is the third edition,
                        which is also regarded by editors as the most authoritative. Changes are
                        made only where there is a good case for authorial intention as indicated in
                        subsequent editions; inconsistencies due to the printing process where there
                        is no clear authorial intention have generally been left as-is except in the
                        rare occasions when they would compromise the meaning of the text. The text
                        of the play in this edition has been compared to those by Peter Lewis
                        (1973), David Fuller (1983), and Hal Gladfelder (2013). Thanks to Prof.
                        Gladfelder for making an electronic version of his edition available.

                        editorial decisions are available on the associated website.</p>

                    <p> IF Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am sure No-body can dispute mine. I own
                        myself of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their Weekly Festivals
                        at St. <placeName ref="#Giles"><hi rend="italic">Giles</hi></placeName>â€™s. I
                        have a small Yearly Salary for my Catches, and am welcome to a Dinner there
                        whenever I please, which is more than most Poets can say.</p>

                    <p> As we live by the Muses, â€™tis but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical
                        Merit where-ever we find it. The Muses, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no
                        Distinction to Dress, and never partially mistake the Pertness of Embroidery
                        for Wit, nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness. Be the Author who he will, we
                        push his Play as far as it will go. So (though you are in Want) I wish you
                        Success heartily.</p>

                        two most excellent Ballad-Singers. I have introducâ€™d the Similes that are in
                        all your celebrated <hi rend="italic">Operas:</hi> The <hi rend="italic"

                            >Flower</hi>, &amp;c. Besides, I have a Prison Scene which the Ladies
                        always reckon charmingly pathetick. As to the Parts, I have observâ€™d such a
                        nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impossible for either of
                        them to take Offence. I hope I may be forgiven, that I have not made my
                        Opera throughout unnatural, like those in vogue; for I have no Recitative:
                        Excepting this, as I have consented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue,
                        it must be allowâ€™d an Opera in all its forms. The Piece indeed hath been
                        heretofore frequently represented by ourselves in our great Room at St.

                            my Dear, how shall we be safe? Are we not then in her Husband's Power?

                        <p> The hard Times oblige me to go very near in my Dealing.â€”â€”â€”To be sure,
                            of late Years I have been a great Sufferer by the Parliament.â€”â€”â€”Three
                            thousand Pounds would hardly make me amends.â€”â€”â€”The Act for destroying
                            the <placeName ref="#Mint">Mint</placeName>, was a severe Cut upon our
                            Businessâ€”â€”â€”'Till then, if a Customer stept out of the wayâ€”â€”â€”we knew
                            where to have herâ€”â€”â€”No doubt you know Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Coaxer</hi>â€”â€”â€”there's a Wench now ('till to-day) with a good Suit
                            of Cloaths of mine upon her Back, and I could never set Eyes upon her
                            for three Months together.â€”â€”â€”Since the Act too against Imprisonment for
                            small Sums, my Loss there too hath been very considerable, and it must
                            be so, when a Lady can borrow a handsome Petticoat, or a clean Gown, and
                            I not have the least Hank upon her! And, o' my Conscience, now-a-days
                            most Ladies take a Delight in cheating, when they can do it with
                            Safety.</p>

                        <p> Consider, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Peachum</hi>, that Watch was remarkable,
                            and not of very safe Sale.â€”â€”â€”If you have any black Velvet
                            Scarfsâ€”â€”â€”they are a handsome Winter-wear; and take with most Gentlemen
                            who deal with my Customers.â€”â€”â€”'Tis I that put the Ladies upon a good
                            Foot. 'Tis not Youth or Beauty that fixes their Price. The Gentlemen
                            always pay according to their Dress, from half a Crown to two Guineas;
                            and yet those Hussies make nothing of bilking of me.â€”â€”â€”Then too,
                            allowing for Accidents.â€”â€”â€”I have eleven fine Customers now down under
                            the Surgeons Hands,--what with Fees and other Expences, there are great
                            Goings-out, and no Comings-in, and not a Farthing to pay for at least a
                            Months cloathing.â€”â€”â€”We run great Risquesâ€”â€”â€”great Risques indeed.</p>
